# Tasks

## Plan

- Simplify the search highlight
  - Its either favorite or hide
- we need better styling for the home tab
  - the big glow button are not very appealing
  - the top section is too fat
- make the icons more tightly package much like a phone screen
  - have 5 icons in a row, and they should have 2 rows of text each
  - having 2 row descriptions for the icons is okay much like a phone screen
  - not in the icon field we need to move it up, i tried to but now its not showing
- make sure our bottom right corner toggle sidebar button is always above the icons, no matter what site is loaded, but obviously we want it behind the side panel when that is open, no fixed a site icon still covering it

## Do

- [x] we need to be able order the icons by drag, so if i drag the 3rd icon between the 1st and 2nd icon, it becomes the 2nd icon

- [x] the back to home button is in the rught place but we need to style it better, it could take up the whole space
  - this is almsot perfect but i 

## Done

- [x] the home bg should be the same as the chat tab bg
- add current and add site butttons should be the same size
  - they are not currently
- add site button changes
  - site name first
  - site url second
  - then cancel button left side and add button right side
  - then icon url third
  - better styling for the whole thing
