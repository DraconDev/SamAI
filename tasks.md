# Tasks

## Plan
- Simplify the search highlight
  - Its either favorite or hide

## Do

- we need better styling for the home page
  - the styling got worse with the last update
- we need to be able order the icons by drag, so if i drag the 3rd icon between the 1st and 2nd icon, it becomes the 2nd icon
- make the icons more tightly package much like a phone screen
- having 2 row descriptions for the icons is okay much like a phone screen
  - we have this not kind but we are not cutting of the 3rd row, we see part of it 
- back to home button should be below the search and add site button, taking up the full width, but on the same panel, not among the icons 
- make sure our bottom right corner toggle sidebar button is always above the icons, no matter what site is loaded, but obviously we want it behind the side panel when that is open

## Done

- add current and add site butttons should be the same size
  - they are not currently 
- add site button changes
  - site name first
  - site url second
  - then cancel button left side and add button right side
  - then icon url third
  - better styling for the whole thing
