## Do

- add current and add site should be the same size
- we need better styling for the home page
- we need to be able order the icons by drag, so if i drag the 3rd icon between the 1st and 2nd icon, it becomes the 2nd icon
- make the icons more tightly package much like a phone screen
- having 2 row descriptions for the icons is okay much like a phone screen
- back to home button should be below the search and add site button, taking up the full width, but on the same panel, not among the icons 

## Done

- add site button changes
  - site name first
  - site url second
  - then cancel button left side and add button right side
  - then icon url third
  - better styling for the whole thing
