# Tasks

## Plan

- Simplify the search highlight
  - Its either favorite or hide
- we need better styling for the home tab
  - the big glow button are not very appealing
  - the top section is too fat
- make the icons more tightly package much like a phone screen
  - have 5 icons in a row, and they should have 2 rows of text each
  - having 2 row descriptions for the icons is okay much like a phone screen
- make sure our bottom right corner toggle sidebar button is always above the icons, no matter what site is loaded, but obviously we want it behind the side panel when that is open, no fixed a site icon still covering it

## Do

- [x] we need to be able order the icons by drag, so if i drag the 3rd icon between the 1st and 2nd icon, it becomes the 2nd icon

  - keep in mind that we have the drag on mechanic that allows us to create folders, so that might be making this harder cause its not working now

- [x] the back to home button is in the rught place but we need to style it better, it could take up the whole space
  - this is almost perfect but i the button to take up the whole space, no rounded courses either, and make it more much cooler
  - make it have a much cooler i
- [x] lets have 5 icons in a row, and they should have 2 rows of text each

## Done

- [x] the home bg should be the same as the chat tab bg
- add current and add site butttons should be the same size
  - they are not currently
- add site button changes
  - site name first
  - site url second
  - then cancel button left side and add button right side
  - then icon url third
  - better styling for the whole thing
