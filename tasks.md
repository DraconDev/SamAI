# Tasks

## Plan

- Simplify the search highlight
  - Its either favorite or hide
- we need better styling for the home tab
- make sure our bottom right corner toggle sidebar button is always above the icons, no matter what site is loaded, but obviously we want it behind the side panel when that is open, no fixed a site icon still covering it

## Do

- [x] we need to be able order the icons by drag, so if i drag the 3rd icon between the 1st and 2nd icon, it becomes the 2nd icon
  - keep in mind that we have the drag on mechanic that allows us to create folders, so that might be making this harder cause its not working now

- [x] the back to home button is in the rught place but we need to style it better, it could take up the whole space
  - this is almost perfect but i the button to take up the whole space, no rounded courses either, and make it more much cooler
  - make it have a much cooler icon and round corners
- make the icons more tightly packet much like a phone screen, this also allows more space for text

- What if we didn't have those big add current and add site buttons and instead we had normal sized buttons in the icon grid, and one of the buttons was a plus always at the end to add select between adding current site, custom site, or custom folder
  - this would make the whole thing more compact and allow more icons to be visible at once
  - presumably this would also fix our drag and drop issue, cause here me our we can drag and drop issue cause lets say folders come first, then sites, then the add button is last, so whe we drag and drop a site to reorder between sites but when we hover over folder we add to the folder instead of reordering
  - same with folders, we can reorder between folders, but we cant put a folder into another folder, so drag and drop works perfectly here


## Done

- [x] the home bg should be the same as the chat tab bg
- add current and add site butttons should be the same size
  - they are not currently
- add site button changes
  - site name first
  - site url second
  - then cancel button left side and add button right side
  - then icon url third
  - better styling for the whole thing
